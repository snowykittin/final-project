# Minecraft in React - N320 Final Project

This project involves mimicing Minecraft using Three JS and React. I followed along a YouTube tutorial demo, which is linked at the bottom. However, to go above and beyond simply following a tutorial for this project, I have employed some tweaks. This involves using more blocks than the original demo, a toggle for a help menu for keys and instructions, a potential fix to the off-set for locking cursor position to the camera, and more.

How I did it can be seen in this Youtube video:
